/**
 * How long each phase of launcher startup took, printed as one line when it hands off to the server.
 *
 * <p>This exists because "startup is slow" could not be answered from the code. The launcher does
 * several things that each look cheap and are not always - it reads the whole shipped jar more than
 * once, extracts embedded libraries, and asks GitHub about releases over the network - and which of
 * them costs anything depends on the disk, the machine and whether the network answers at all. A
 * phase breakdown turns the next boot log into the answer rather than something to reason about.</p>
 *
 * <p>One line, always on. A breakdown that has to be switched on is one nobody has when they need
 * it, and the cost is a few nanoTime calls against phases measured in milliseconds.</p>
