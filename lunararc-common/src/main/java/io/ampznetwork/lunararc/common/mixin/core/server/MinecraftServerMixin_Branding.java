/**
 * Puts LunarArc's identity where someone reading a report will find it.
 *
 * <p>A crash report from a stranger says which Minecraft, which loader and which mods, and then
 * "lunararc" with a version string that maps to nothing. Version, build number, branch and commit
 * together make a report answerable without having to ask the reporter anything, which matters
 * because usually they cannot be asked.</p>
 *
 * <p>It goes in two places for two audiences: the system report, which is what a crash log carries
 * and what a bot scraping crash reports can read, and one line on startup, which is what someone
 * watching a console sees.</p>
