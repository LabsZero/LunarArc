An experimental hybrid Minecraft server compatibility layer. **Forge/NeoForge/Fabric/Quilt**, while LunarArc layers Bukkit/Spigot/Paper plugin compatibility on top with concrete Craft-style adapters and targeted mixins. Paper is an API/behaviour contract and merge reference, not a second shaded server runtime.
