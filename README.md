An experimental PaperMC server bridge built to unify the modding ecosystem. While many hybrid servers exist, few successfully unify the PaperMC core with diverse mod loaders; **LunarArc** aims to fill that gap by providing seamless support for **Fabric**, **Quilt**, **Forge**, and **NeoForge** mods on a high performance Paper foundation.

## Credits & Upstream Projects

LunarArc is built upon the incredible work of the following projects:

- **[NeoForge](https://neoforged.net/)**: The modern modding platform for Minecraft.
- **[Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/)**: A lightweight, experimental modding toolchain.
- **[Forge](https://minecraftforge.net/)**: The classic modding API.
- **[Quilt](https://quiltmc.org/)**: The open-source, community-driven modding toolchain.
- **[PaperMC](https://papermc.io/)**: High-performance Minecraft server implementation.
- **[Architectury](https://architectury.dev/)**: Multi-platform modding abstraction layer.
- **[Arclight](https://github.com/IzzelAliz/Arclight)**: Bridge+Mixin architecture, single-JAR bootstrap pattern (`LunarArcAgent` premain/`Instrumentation`), `IModLocatorService` self-registration, class-space unification via `PluginClassLoader`, and Velocity forwarding patterns are all inspired by and adapted from Arclight. LunarArc would not exist without this foundational work.
- **[Youer](https://github.com/MohistMC/Youer)**: Inspiration for Paper 1.21.1+ compatibility and ServiceLoader-based build metadata.
- **[SpongePowered](https://www.spongepowered.org/)**: Mixin and project structure inspiration.

Special thanks to the open-source community for making hybrid server development possible.
